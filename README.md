# Basic Todo List Site

A basic todo list site made using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node.js).

It's really simple, users can add tasks to the list and delete them.

A lot of the code in this project is from [freeCodeCamp.org's PERN Stack Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8)
